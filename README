Data-Random-String version 0.03
===============================

This module implements a simple method for generating random text
strings that can be used in a variety of applications.

I make no claim of this module being able to generate unique 
strings, just random. If you need to generate truly unique
identifies you may like to look at Data::UUID or better still
Data::GUID.


INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES

None.
